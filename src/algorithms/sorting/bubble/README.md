## Bubble sort or sinking sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

This algoritmh does not perform well in the real world but It should be here because It is very important for education and almost everyone learns this algoritmh firstly.

This animated gif on Wikipedia presents how this algorithms works.
